The FFC lib
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## What is this project?

**FFC** (Fred’s fastai cookbook) is not your usual library. It does not
intend to fill a gap in the development ecosystem, its purpose is to
fill a gap in my own brain.

Inspired by Zach Muller’s [Walk with fastai](walkwithfastai.com),
**FFC** aims to collect notebooks, snippets, ideas and learnings of my
personal [fastai journey](/blog).

## Install

``` sh
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

## Project structure

This project is built on [nbdev](nbdev.fast.ai). The **nbs** folder is
where the content is produced:

- **nbs/(root)**: nbdev and quarto config files
  - custom.css: my tweaks on the default *cosmo* website theme
- **nbs/blog**: blog content
  <!-- * **nbs/course22**: My personal notes on Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2022 lessons  -->

Nbdev automatically creates the **proc**, **doc** and **ffc** folders.
