Remember not share links to course recordings or materials.
:::
- You can share your notes/learnings, but please don't share links to course recordings or materials.
- Resources Needed:
-- Colab pricing has gone crazy, now is not a bad time to buy a GPU.
-- [Lambda is offering $150 in GPU time](https://forums.fast.ai/t/lambda-gpu-cloud-for-deep-learning-a100s-at-1-10-gpu-hr-150-sign-up-credit).  The challenge is that you cannot pause a lambda instance.
-- For part 2, you may need 16Gb to 24Gb of GPU VRAM for training, 8Gb for inference.
- Check you are tracking [Lesson 9 official topic](https://forums.fast.ai/t/lesson-9-official-topic) (end of the page). The "chat" is the official source of information for the lesson.
- There is a Google [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y18wNzdlY2I2MWVjMmRlOGI5MzE3ZGE2NmQxNmM1NTIwNDEwODRkNDFkZjllMTU0ZTZiNzAyNjgwMGYxNzQyNzU5QGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) for lessons
- Lesson 9 is divided in 3 parts (links in [Lesson 9 official topic](https://forums.fast.ai/t/lesson-9-official-topic)):
  - This stream
  - Lesson 9A from [Jonathan Whitaker (@johnowhitaker)](https://forums.fast.ai/u/johnowhitaker/): A deeper dive on the subject
  - Lesson 9B from [Tanishq (@ilovescience)](https://forums.fast.ai/u/ilovescience) and [Wasim (@seem)](https://forums.fast.ai/u/seem): About the math. *To be released*. 
- diffusion-nbs repo: things to start to play with stable diffusion
- It is recommended to take a look on the [background links](https://forums.fast.ai/t/lesson-9-official-topic/100562/2#useful-background-on-fastai-courses-3)
  - another suggestion was [Radek's](https://forums.fast.ai/u/seem) [Meta Learning](https://radekosmulski.com/meta-learning-introduction/) book
- There will be always little bit of logistics talk before the recording of each lesson. The official recording starts when slide with title appears.
- [Study groups](https://forums.fast.ai/t/all-the-study-groups/) make learning more fun
-- The [SF Study Group](https://forums.fast.ai/t/study-groups-in-sf/) is the one running longer

## Introduction [20:58]
- First lesson of part 2: "Deep learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion"
- (Im)practical: we will a learn a lot of details that are not really necessary for using, but will be important for research.
- We will do a quick run on how to use **Stable Diffusion**
- If you haven't done DL before, will be hard. Strongly suggest doing [Part 1](https://forums.fast.ai/t/lesson-1-official-topic/) before this part.
- Stable diffusion is moving quickly. 
  - Even as of recording, the Lesson Notebook is a little bit outdated.
  - But don't worry, the foundations don't change so much.

:::


#### What has changed from previous courses
- No longer all centered in Jeremy
- influenced by Fast.ai alumini
  - [Jonathan Whitaker (@johnowhitaker)]: first to create educational material
  - [Wasim Lorgat (@seem)](https://forums.fast.ai/u/seem): extraordinary fastai contributor
  - [Pedro Cuenca (@pcuenq)](https://forums.fast.ai/u/pcuenq/): came to SF last course and it is now at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/)
  - [Tanishq (@ilovescience)](https://forums.fast.ai/u/ilovescience): now at stability.ai, expertise on medical applications

#### Compute
Part 2 requires more compute. Check options in course.fast.ai:

 - [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is still good, but is getting pricier
 - [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/gradient) Gradient 
 - [Jarvis](https://jarvis-labs.xyz/) Labs: made by fastai alumni and loved by many students
 - [Lambda](https://lambdalabs.com/) Labs is the most recent provider. They are the cheapeast (at the moment)
 - GPU prices are going down


## Play with Stable Diffusion! [37:30]
-  [fastai/diffusion-nbs](https://github.com/fastai/diffusion-nbs)
  - references to tools and cool stuff
- **Play a lot!** It is important to play and learn the capabilities and limitations
- the community has moved towards keeping code available as colab notebooks
  - example: [Deforum](https://deforum.github.io/)
- The best way to learn about prompts is (Lexica.art)[lexica.art]
- By the end of this course we will understand how prompts work and go beyond with new data types

## Stable Diffusion with 🤗 Diffusers [42:00]
- [Notebook](https://github.com/fastai/diffusion-nbs/blob/master/stable_diffusion.ipynb) 
- [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/diffusers_intro.ipynb) is [HuggingFace](huggingface.co) library for Stable Diffusion
  - at the moment the recommended library
  - HF 🤗 has doing a great good job on being pionneers
  - HF pipeline is similar to fastai learn
``` python
torch.manual_seed(1024)
num_rows,num_cols = 5,5
pipe.safety_checker = lambda images, clip_input: (images, False)
images = concat(pipe(prompt="a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse", num_inference_steps=s, guidance_scale=7).images for s in  list(range(2,100,4)))
```
![Image output of the inference with different number of steps (from 2 to 98 steps, increasing 4 steps per image).](5x5.png){#fig-5x5 width=90%}

- inference is quite different to what we have been used to in fastai
  - usage of prompts, guidance scale, etc
  - these models require many steps
  - research is reducing the number of steps, but good results still require many

:::{.callout-tip}
## Fred's observations
It seems that a high number of steps can be detrimental  to the final quality, but this hunch needs more experimentation
:::

-  guidance scale says to what degree we should be focusing on the caption (prompt)
  - JH has the feeling that there is something to be done in this _function_

![Image output of the inference with different number degrees in the guidance scale for each row.](4x4.png){#fig-4x4 width=70%}

- negative_prompt: will take the prompt and create a second image that respond to the negative_prompt and subtract from the first one


#### 🤗 Diffuser Img2Img Pipeline
  - you can create something with the  composition you are looking for
  - you can use the output of a previous result as input

#### Fine tunning 🤗 Diffuser model
- textual inversion: you actually fine tune a single embedding. 
    - give the concept a name (token)
    - give the example pictures this token and add to the model

- Dreambooth
    -  takes a not so used token and finetune just this token

## How it works
- We will use a different explanation to what is commonly explained

- Imagine a magic api `f``...
- img X_1-> `f` -> p_isDigit(X_1)=0.98
- img X_2-> `f` -> p_isDigit(X_2)=0.4
- img X_2-> `f` -> p_isDigit(X_2)=0.02

- if you have this magic api, you can use it to create images.
- if we change a pixel, what is the probability now? 
- we calculated the gradient of the probability of X_3 being a hand written digit:
$\frac{\Lambda p_{\text{isDigit}}(X_3)}{\Lambda X_3}$
- instead of using the gradient to change the model, we are changing the input
-- pixel by pixel is the finite differencing -> very slow
-- instead, we could just use `f.backward()` and get X_3.grad
