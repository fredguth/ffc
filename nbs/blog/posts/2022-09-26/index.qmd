The [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course has a top-down approach to teaching.  Let's **not** *start from the basics*, but from our goals. In the first lesson, you learn how to build a classifier that would be science fiction in 2015. Neat! Equally important, thought, is what is implicit: a requirement for a [top-down approach to learning](https://forums.fast.ai/t/learning-strategy-for-top-down-approach/66173):

## doc(_function_)
While running the lesson notebook, use `doc(fn)` to access the _function_'s documentation.

## What is a fast.ai cookbook?
A cookbook is a collection of recipes. A fastai recipe is a jupyter notebook where you compile steps that you can follow to reproduce a result using the library. But you do that in a literate programming style, _ie_ you add explanations and annotations to the code.

## playground
Many fastai cookbooks use the name `playground`. 
:::
There are a list of some interesting fast.ai cookbooks in Github:

 - [Zachary Mueller's cookbook](https://walkwithfastai.com/)
 - [Sylvain's cookbook](https://github.com/sgugger/Deep-Learning)
 - [Fred's old cookbook](https://github.com/fredguth/fastai_playground)
 - [Sunhwan's cookbook](https://github.com/sunhwan/fastai-playground)
 - [Kechan's cookbook](https://github.com/kechan/FastaiPlayground)
 - ~~Severus Snape's cookbook~~

### Why build a cookbook?
 A cookbook enables reproducibility, but as important... it allows _you_ to come back to your work in a few months and understand what you did. **It is a gift for your future self.**

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Watch lecture) --> B(Run lesson notebook)
  B --> C(Reproduce)
  C --Different dataset--> C
  C --> D(Share learnings)
  D:::someclass
  classDef someclass fill:#f96;

```
Besides, when you share your learnings you need to structure your thought and that makes you check for gaps in your understanding and solidifies what you have learned.

### How to build a cookbook?
The best way to document your fastai learnings is using [nbdev](nbdev.fast.ai), which is the development tool used to build and document `fast.ai` lib itself. That is how this `Fred's fast.ai cookbook` was made. You can just fork [my repo](https://github.com/fredguth/ffc) or follow the [nbdev tutorial](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html) (that is what I did).
